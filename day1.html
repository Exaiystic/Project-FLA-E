			<h4>5:30am earth uk time</h4>
		    <p>
			    Takeoff yesterday was a success. I escaped velocity around 8:00pm and I 
				am already losing the sense of day and night. I brought my phone with me which, 
				albeit useless otherwise, is adjusted to the time in england.
            </p>
			
			<p>
			    I feel like I am a bird who's just learnt how to fly; there's no sense of 
				which direction is up, down, left, right or anything. I felt full of adrenaline 
				and my body feels as light as a feather. Outside of the ship was a smug black 
				void, yet it was so bright. It was true solitude, but at the same time, it wasn't. 
				It was a park. A panoramic view of playful children dancing around, laughing 
				and chattering, playing in galactic sandboxes, splashing dust around until more 
				children popped into vision with an explosive entry. Behind me was earth. I 
				glanced at it, and, suddenly, I heard the noise of busy roads, street chatter and 
				the honking of horns fade away. I felt the company of 7 billions souls 
				disappear. But when I turned around and looked at this website, I felt warmth, 
				as if I was around a campfire with friends, sharing my story. I do not 
				know how many people there are viewing it. But no matter how 
				many or how few, there is enough space around this campfire for you all. 
				Everybody is welcome here.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Anyway, I am tired and need to get some sleep. Goodnight, Earth.				
		    </p>
			
			<p>
			    Good night, readers, see you tomorrow.
