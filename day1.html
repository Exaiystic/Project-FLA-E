			<h4>5:30am earth uk time</h4>
		    <p>
			    Takeoff yesterday was a success. I escaped velocity around 8:00pm and I 
				am already losing the sense of time. I brought my phone with me which, 
				albeit useless otherwise, is adjusted to the time in england.
            </p>
			
			<p>
			    I feel like I am a bird who's just learnt how to fly; there's no sense of 
				which direction is up, down, left, right or anything. I felt full of adrenaline 
				and my body felt as light as a feather. Outside of the ship was a smug black 
				void, yet it was so bright. No matter where I looked a blanket of stars 
				greeted me. Behind me was earth. I glanced at it, and, suddenly, I heard the 
				noise of busy roads, street chatter and the honking of horns fade away. I felt 
				the company of 7 billions souls disappear. But when I turned around and looked 
				at this website, I felt warmth, as if around a campfire with friends, sharing my 
				story. I do not know how many people there are viewing it. But no matter how 
				many or how few, there is enough space around this campfire for you all. 
				Everybody is welcome here.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Anyway, I am tired and need to get some sleep. Goodnight, Earth.

			    Good night, readers.
