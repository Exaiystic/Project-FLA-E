		    <p>
			    Project: FLA-E is a space expedition to the planets outside of our solar system. The 
				expedition will be carried out by me, Exaiystic. I will use this website as a 
				journal for all of the places that I will visit during the expedition. I have planned 
				the expedition to be anywhere between 5 - 20 years, depending on what I will find whilst 
				exploring the planets within our Milky Way Galaxy.

		    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
			<p>
			    I was born on the 19th June 2001 to two parents who I never knew. I was taken to an 
				orphanage until I was 18, which is when I went to university, but 
				left nearly immediately because of the lack of challenge and content that I didn't 
				already know. Not to brag, but I would call myself a tad smart.
			</p>
			
			<p>
		        If I am to be called something, call me 'Exaiystic'. Why? If my name is to be heard in 
				civilization, it must be that of nobody's before me. But what does 'Exaiystic' mean? Does 
				it have to mean anything? Well, that depends on how loud it echoes.

		    <h3>Why am I doing this?</h3>
		    <p>
		        To me, earth - and everything living on it - is locked inside a closet in a room full of 
				wonder. We cannot see anything outside of the closet, our sights are limited to what 
				is inside the closet, we do not know what is outside of the closet, we can only guess by
			    listening to the muffled noises coming from outside.
		    </p>
			
			<p>
			    When you look up at the sky, do you feel anything? I feel a sense of imperfect solitude, 
				a limbo between loneliness and being watched over, like a hawk spying it's prey.

		        Probably what most of you want to know, how will I manage to escape earth and it's 
				velocity? Simple! A budget-friendly rocket ship! You can read more about my craft, and 
				all of the other resources I will bring with me <a>here</a>
