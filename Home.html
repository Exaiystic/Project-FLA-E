		    <p>
			    Project: FLA-E is a space expedition to the planets outside of our solar system. The 
				expedition will be carried out by me, Exaiystic. I will use this website as a 
				journal for all of the places that I will visit during the expedition. I have planned 
				the expedition to be anywhere between 5 - 20 years, depending on what I will find whilst 
				exploring the planets within our Milky Way Galaxy.

		    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
		    <p>
		        If I am to be called something, call me 'Exaiystic'. Why? If my name is to be heard in 
				civilization, it must be that of nobody's before me. But what does 'Exaiystic' mean? Does 
				it have to mean anything? Well, that depends on how loud it echoes, and the bats guided 
				by the beats.
