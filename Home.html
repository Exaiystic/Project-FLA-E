		    <p>
			    Project: FLA-E is a space expedition to the planets outside of our solar system. The 
				expedition will be carried out by me, Exaiystic. I will use this website as a 
				journal for all of the places that I will visit during the expedition. I have planned 
				the expedition to be anywhere between 5 - 20 years, depending on what I will find whilst 
				exploring the planets within our Milky Way Galaxy.

		    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
			<p>
			    I was born on the 19th June 2001 to two parents who I never knew. I was taken to an 
				orphanage until I was 18, which is when I went to university, but 
				left nearly immediately because of the lack of challenge and content that I didn't 
				already know. Not to brag, but I would call myself a tad smart.
			</p>
			
			<p>
		        If I am to be called something, call me 'Exaiystic'. Why? If my name is to be heard in 
				civilization, it must be that of nobody's before me. But what does 'Exaiystic' mean? Does 
				it have to mean anything? Well, that depends on how loud it echoes.

		    <h3>Why am I doing this?</h3>
		    <p>
		        Space is a interesting, yet scary place. Nobody can deny that. No other human has ever 
				traveled further than the moon. I, however, have the resources and the know-how to be 
				the first...so why not?

		    <h3>How?</h3>
		    <p>
		        Probably what most of you want to know, how will I manage to escape earth and it's 
				velocity? Simple! A budget-friendly rocket ship! 
		    </p>
			
			<p>
			    My journey shall be done within a home-made space craft, named Pioneer-Alice. I have 
				constructed the space craft out of scrap materials that I have refined myself to create 
				an alloy that posses similar properties to that of stainless steel. This means that 
				I should not have to worry about the space craft taking damage on easily when traveling 
				through space. The alloy also has a melting point of up to 900 degrees Celsius so I 
				should not have to worry about the spacecraft burning up on entering a planetary atmosphere 
				(at least earth's anyway). She is about the size of a minibus meaning that I have 
				plenty of free space to move around in. The ship is capable of traveling at up to 90% light 
				speed after an 
				hour ramp up time for up to 5 hours. Pioneer-Alice can also quantum teleport a distance of 
				up to a quarter of a light year every hour when enough energy has been built up.
				Built into Pioneer-Alice are also some measurement instruments, 
				which will allow me to record data about a planet from the safety of my ship. The ship is 
				equipped with technology that is able to rearrange atoms into resources needed for survival 
				(oxygen, food, water, etc), all of which is powered through solar panels and solar turbines. 
				Lastly, the ship is fitted with a few dozen mini-drones that are capable of repairing the ship 
				and capturing pictures of my journey from third person perspectives.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			    I will be bringing a few space suits with me too, which will allow me to traverse planets 
				with increased safety. My suit is also equipped with the same technology as my ship, essentially 
				meaning that I will be able to survive without the dependency of my ship.

		    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
		    <p>
		        The odds of my survival are that to nil. That is fine with me. I am doing this for the 
				experience of a lifetime, and even if something was to go wrong before I even leave 
				earth, I will go down knowing that I have tried to do the impossible before any other 
				man or woman has even attempted it.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			    This website, in essence, is a portal into the future. It will be what we can expect from 
				the future, when space travel is as easy as driving to the shop. Even though I will soon 
				be the loneliest human ever, I am not alone. Because everyone reading forward will be joining 
				my adventure. Thank you.
