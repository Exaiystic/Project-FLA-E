			    Good Morning, Everyone!
			</p>
			
			<p>
			    Feeling rejuvenated now, and so while I was waiting for a quantum jump to charge up, 
				I decided to boot up my old Wii and started playing some Wii Sports to dispel some energy. 
				The energy that my ship stores is divided into two segments: vitals such as food, and 
				luxuries such as energy for my computer, as well as some old game consoles I chose to bring. 
				Whilst online games are not an option, I can still download games from online stores, 
				it will just take a long time. 
			</p>
			
			<h4>7:45am earth uk time</h4>
			
			<p>
			    I have just performed my first quantum jump. The only sign telling me that I had jumped 
				was a tiny jolt that I felt during the jump. Nothing outside of the cockpit had changed, and 
				honestly, it goes to show you how far away everything is. Of course, if you have an 
				interest in all that is space, you probably know this, but it can never be put into scale 
				until you jump a quarter of a light year and notice no visible difference, despite the fact 
				that you just jumped the distance of 163 solar systems. If I made a quantum jump like this 
				every hour, I would be able to reach my first destination, Alpha Centauri in 20 hours. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			    Alpha Centauri is a star system made up of three stars, with at least one planet in the 
				'habitable zone' - an area that has the right temperature conditions for water to be liquid and, 
				therefore, support life. I can't wait to get there. I think while I wait for another jump to 
				be ready, I'll listen to some relaxing music and watch time fly by.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			    But wait, does time exist in space? On earth, we can sit and watch the events of time fold out 
				in front us. In space, nothing happens, as if watching a still image expecting something to 
				happen. Inside my ship, I can watch my clock move forward in time, but outside of the ship, 
				nothing. I pondered about this until another jump was ready.
