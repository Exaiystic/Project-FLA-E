			    Good Morning, Everyone!

			    Feeling rejuvenated now, and so while I was waiting for a quantum jump to charge up, 
				I decided to boot up my old Wii and started playing some Wii Sports to dispel some energy. 
				The energy that my ship stores is divided into two segments: vitals such as food, and 
				luxuries such as energy for my computer, as well as some old game consoles I chose to bring. 
				Whilst online games are not an option, I can still download games from online stores, 
				it will just take a long time.

			<h4>7:45am earth uk time</h4>

			    I have just performed my first quantum jump. The only sign telling me that I had jumped 
				was a tiny jolt that I felt during the jump. Nothing outside of the cockpit had changed, and 
				honestly, it goes to show you how far away everything is. Of course, if you have an 
				interest in all that is space, you probably know this, but it can never be put into scale 
				until you jump a quarter of a light year and notice no visible difference, despite the fact 
				that you just jumped the distance of 163 solar systems.
